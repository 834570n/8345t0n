WEB HACKING WORKFLOW

=== Mapping the Attack Surface ===
- Client-side validation        Checks may not be replicated on the server
- Database interaction          SQL injection
- File upload/download          Path traversal, stored XSS
- Display of user-supplied data XSS
- Dynamic redirects             Redirection and header injection
- Social networking features    Username enumeration, stored XSS
- Login                         Username enumeration, weak passwords, brute force
- Multistage login              Logic flaws
- Session state                 Predictable tokens, insecure handling of tokens
- Access controls               Horizontal and vertical privesc
- User impersonation functions  Privesc
- Cleartext communications      Session hijacking, capture of creds and other sensitive data
- Off-site links                Leakage of query string parameters in Referer header
- Interfaces to ext systems     Shortcuts in handling of sessions/access controls
- Error messages                Information leakage
- E-mail interaction            E-mail/command injection
- Native code components        Buffer overflow
- Indentifiable web server      Common configuration weaknesses, known software bugs

=== Common Findings ===
Access Controls
- Cookies set to parent domain
- Insecure Access-Control-Allow-Origin-Header
- Session handling
    - App does not use redirect upon session expiration
    - No session timeout/timeout too long
    - Session does not expire upon tab closure
    - Session fixation
    - Session ID cookie not set with HTTP Only flag
    - Session ID cookies not marked as Secure
    - Session remains active after logout
    - Session tracking cookie value predictable
- Privesc

Authentication
- Account harvesting through system login messages
- Account harvesting through account lockout
- Account harvesting through user registration/management
- Admin login accessible through internet
- App uses email address as username
- Browser autocomplete allowed after authentication
- Browser autocomplete enabled before authentication
- Citigroup password policy violation
- Incomplete sign-off
- Logout function not available on every page
- No account lockout after 6 failed attempts
- User can bypass password policies
- User can bypass password policies post auth

Application Logic
- Ability to bypass business logic
- Messages can be configured by user post auth
- Messages can be configured by user pre auth
- Validation logic not implemented

Information Disclosure
- Banner advertises service/version
- Confidential information passed in cleartext in GET URL
- Default files/information gathering
- Information disclosure .NET errors
- Microsoft ASP.NET debug enabled
- Private IP address leaked in HTTP headers
- Sensitive information cached to disk
- Sensitive information obtained
- Sensitive information stored in persistent cookie in clear text
- Sensitive information stored in persistent cookie in clear text post auth
- Sensitive information stored on disk HTML 5
- Suspicious files found in recursive directory
- Suspicious files found in recursive directory post auth
- Temporary files download .bak
- Temporary files download .bak post auth
- Test/debug/old/backup files present

Web Server
- Cache POST request returns 200 OK server response
- Cache POST request returns 200 OK server response post authentication
- Forceful browsing
- General patch management
- HTTP Headers
    - Insecure HTTP methods enabled for directory
    - Secure headers not used
- IPv6 is enabled
- Upload function can be used to upload malicious files/scripts
- Weak encryption
    - Extended validation TLS/SSL certificates
    - Vulnerable TLS protocol in use

    * sslyze
    * nmap nse script

307313 (64615):H5 Closed in UAT pending PCV
307313 (64615):H6 Dev attestation for case 2 as it is out of scope

64621:H3 nmap nse ssl-cert
- Finding still open handle internally
64621:M2 check URL for logout functionality
64621:M3 check if library is gone
- Login and go to pages if unauth cant reach
- Cant close until vuln library is gone
- Check current version of library
- Run sslabs check

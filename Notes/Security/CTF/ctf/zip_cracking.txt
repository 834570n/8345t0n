Sometimes zip files are protected with a password.
You can attempt to crack the password with tools
like john and fcrackzip

fcrackzip -D -v -u -p /path/to/dictionary.txt zipfile.zip

-D  Dictionary attack
-v  Verbose
-u  Tries to unzip first file with current password guess (removes false positives)
-p  Password dictionary file

zip2john zipfile.zip > hash.txt
john --format=zip hash.txt
